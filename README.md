# NLP_for_classification
This project demonstrates how to preprocess movie review data for sentiment analysis using BERT's tokenizer. The goal is to convert raw text reviews into a format suitable for input into a BERT-based model, enabling classification of reviews as positive or negative.

Overview
Task: Sentiment classification (positive/negative) of movie reviews.
Method: Tokenization using Hugging Face's transformers library and BERT's vocabulary.
Output: Tokenized datasets ready for model training and evaluation.


Example
text	|  label
"A fantastic movie, loved it!"	|  positive
"Terrible plot and bad acting."	|  negative
